I am setting this up to:
1. Review setting up a directory/repository with git
2. Practice setting up a virtual environment
3. Create new Python files and practice coding in Python
4. Create an automatic way to check for code errors
5. Review making branches and commits
6. Check is someone can download my repository and use it with the virtual environment
